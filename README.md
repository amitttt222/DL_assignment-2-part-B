    Assignment 2 part B Course Assignment of CS6910 Deep Learning IIT Madras
## Abstract<br/>
This assignment involves fine-tuning the pre-trained GoogleNet model on the inaturalist12k dataset. The inaturalist12k dataset is a large-scale image classification dataset that contains over 12,000 species of plants and animals, with each species having at least 1,000 images. The goal of this project is to fine-tune the GoogleNet model to accurately classify images from the inaturalist12k dataset.
## Dataset<br/>
The inaturalist12k dataset is a large-scale image classification dataset that contains over 12,000 species of plants and animals, with each species having at least 1,000 images. The dataset consists of high-resolution images, with each image being labeled with the corresponding species name. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets, with the training set containing 80% data, the validation set containing 20% data, and the testing set containing 1,930 species and 158,370 images.
## Objective<br/>
The objective of this project is to fine-tune the pre-trained GoogleNet model to accurately classify images from the inaturalist12k dataset. Fine-tuning involves taking a pre-trained model and adapting it to a new dataset by re-training the last few layers of the model. By fine-tuning the GoogleNet model on the inaturalist12k dataset, we aim to achieve high accuracy in classifying images from the dataset. This can have practical applications in various fields, including ecology, conservation biology, and agriculture.
